Dear stakeholders in the GBIF North America region,

As we discussed in our most [recent regional meeting](https://hp-north-america.gbif-staging.org/post/2021/sept-regional-meeting/), we think it is important to engage new people in the North America steering group to maintain momentum. We have proposed an 8-member structure consisting of the Regional Representative (chair), Deputy Regional Representative (vice chair), 3 Node Managers or their delegates, and 3 Community Stakeholders, such as IPT managers.

Responsibilities of the regional steering group include:
* Facilitate regional communication, coordination, and collaboration
* Help and support the Regional Representative and Deputy
** Participate in bi-weekly meetings
** Help with quarterly meetings
** Help with annual region reports
* Willingness to work on projects for the benefit of the community (e.g., the portal)
* Help turn notes and requests from the community into actions

<code><b>If you are interested in joining the steering group, please email your intent to [gbif-na-steering-group@googlegroups.com](gbif-na-steering-group@googlegroups.com) by this Friday, 24 September.</b></code>

Thank you for considering!

Best,

David Jennings, Carole Sinou, Abby Benson, David Bloom, and Sharon Grant
