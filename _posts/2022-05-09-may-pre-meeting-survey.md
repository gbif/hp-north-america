Are you....

**...planning to attend** the North American Regional Nodes Meeting? Please complete the survey to help us to frame our discussions during the session.

**...unable to attend** the meeting? This is a great way to contribute to the conversation and make your thoughts known while you are elsewhere.

**...a Node Manager or Head of Delegation** to a NA GBIF Node? Then we definitely need to hear from you about your efforts for the coming year.

**...just a regular person** involved with biodiversity data? First of all, nobody is just "regular" in this business. Second, we still want to know what you think, so please share it with us.
