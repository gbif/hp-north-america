[GBIF community webinars](https://www.gbif.org/webinars) aim to improve sustained communication and interaction between the Secretariat and the broader GBIF community, 
particularly (but not exclusively) the GBIF nodes. By keeping a keen eye on new projects and initiatives within the context of the 
[GBIF strategic plan](https://www.gbif.org/strategic-plan) and [annual work programme and implementation plan](https://docs.gbif.org/2021-work-programme/en/#gbif-annual-work-programme-2021), 
we hope that these discussions spark new collaboration and engagement opportunities across the network.
