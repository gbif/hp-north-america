## The North America Region has three main goals:

1. Encourage regional collaborative efforts to define best practices for participation, knowledge-sharing, training and capacity enhancement in the North American data-sharing community.
2. Solicit ideas for better coordination across the region, define roles and responsibilities, and clarify the pathway for data mobilization.
3. Encourage future projects to participate in the community using the outcomes from the first two goals.

To meet those goals, the North America Regional Steering Group has implemented quarterly regional meetings and has created a [North America Slack Workspace](https://app.slack.com/client/T012ZB91953/G0185BQHTCH).
