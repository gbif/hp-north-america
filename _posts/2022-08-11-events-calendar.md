The NA Regional Steering Group has just released a brand new [Events Calendar](https://www.gbif-north-america.org/events/).

Several events have already been posted through the end of 2022, including GB29, TDWG 2022, BioDigiCon, and several other workshops and meetings.

If you have events you'd like to post please send us a message at the [NA Regional Helpdesk](mailto:gbif.na.helpdesk@gmail.com). Be sure to tell us:
- the event name
- location (if in person) or link (if virtual)
- event dates
- time and time zone
- and URLs for any event information and registration sites.

Welcome events include conferences, workshops, and meetings that will be of interest to the members of our diverse community, including data-sharing, collections management, data standards, and more.

Dates shown on the calendar should reflect your current time zone.

Please contact the [NA Regional Helpdesk](mailto:gbif.na.helpdesk@gmail.com) with questions.
