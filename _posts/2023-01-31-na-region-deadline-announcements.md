Welcome to 2023! To begin the year, the NA Steering Group would like to share three announcements with the community.

### NA Deputy Regional Representative Elections - Nominations Welcomed

The NA Steering Committee wishes to acknowledge [Carole Sinou](https://www.gbif.org/contact-us/directory?personId=3917), of Canadensys. Carole has served as the Deputy Regional Representative for the last two terms (four years). Due to term limits she must step down, at least for a little while. We wish to thank Carole for all of her service to the North American community and we are pleased that she will remain a member of the NA Steering Group.

Elections to fill the role of Deputy Regional Representative will take place in March, 2023. If you are the Node Manager for a GBIF node in North America and you would like to throw your hat into the ring, please notify the Steering Group [via email](mailto: gbif.na.helpdesk@gmail.com) or [Slack](https://gbif-north-america.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1duj62qwm-PoKZBpZGPX8ZREHkNRqoDw#/shared-invite/email). The Deputy's term is for two years, beginning in April. The Deputy will also become a member of the NA Steering Group.

**Nominations must be submitted before March 1st.**

### Call for proposal for 2023 Capacity Enhancement Support Programme (CESP)

This call aligns with the GBIF Capacity Enhancement Framework and focuses on enhancing the long-term capacity of participants to benefit from and contribute to GBIF's mission of providing free and open access to biodiversity data. Project proposals must target specific capacity needs identified by the participants themselves and be aligned with one or more of the activities in the GBIF Work Programme 2023. GBIF encourages all participants to complete a capacity self-assessment to help identify capacity strengths and needs.

**The deadline for applications is March 14, 2023.** For more information about this program, please visit the [GBIF announcement](https://www.gbif.org/news/54zD9vqmCpyL9dqd24Zd0z/call-for-proposals-for-2023-capacity-enhancement-support-programme-cesp).

### Call for nominations to the 2023 GBIF Graduate Researchers Award

On behalf of the network of national Participants, the GBIF Secretariat is pleased to invite nominations for the 2023 Graduate Researchers Award. This annual programme aims to foster and recognize innovative research and discovery in biodiversity informatics by graduate students whose masterâ€™s and doctoral studies rely on GBIF-mediated data.

**The deadline for nominations is June 19, 2023.** Please review the complete [GBIF announcement](https://www.gbif.org/news/6gyLOum00YsYc4OtVGK33Y/call-for-nominations-to-the-2023-gbif-graduate-researchers-award).

Note from the NA Steering Group - it's been a long time since we had a recipient from Canada. We know there must be some worthy candidates out there. [Please contact Carloe Sinou](mailto: canadensys.network@gmail.com) for assistance with a nomination.
